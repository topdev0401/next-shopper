# Next Shopper

This is a simple e-commerce web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I used the data from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). It is a really cool API to build e-commerce demo projects. I just wanted some extra fields and I copied its data to change it a little.  
**Live demo is [here](https://next-shopper.vercel.app/).**
